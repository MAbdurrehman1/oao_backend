# Contributing to OAO Backend
Thank you for your contributing to OAO Backend project. We appreciate your efforts to enhance and maintain the quality of our application. To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow these guidelines.

## Branching and Naming Conventions
Before you begin working on a new feature or a bug fix, create a separate branch with a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes. Use the following group tokens as prefixes to categorize your work:
>>- **feature/**: New features or functionalities.
>>- **fix/**: Bug fixes.
>>- **docs/**: Documentation updates.
>>- **style/**: Code style and formatting changes.
>>- **refactor/**: Code improvements that don't add features or fix bugs.
>>- **performance/**: Performance enhancements.
>>- **test/**: Adding or updating tests.
>>- **chore/**: Build process or auxiliary tool changes.

For example, if adding a CSV download feature for the second teachers list, name your branch `feature/second_teachers_list_csv_download`.

## Development and Pull Requests

After creating your branch, you may proceed with developing your feature or fix. Regularly commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages. Once development is complete, push your changes to your branch and create a pull request to the `develop` branch. 
_If the code changes needing review exceed 300-400 lines, please consider making multiple pull requests. This will make the review process much easier and more efficient._

In your pull request, provide a detailed description of the changes and their impact. Link your pull request to the corresponding TeamViewer card for cross-referencing, and vice versa. This helps in understanding the context and purpose of your contributions.

## Code Review and Feedback

Once a pull request is opened, notify team members for a review. Address feedback and make necessary changes promptly. Engaging with peer feedback is crucial for maintaining code quality and learning from each other.

## Conflict Resolution

If your pull request has conflicts with the target branch, it's your responsibility to resolve them. We recommend collaborating with the developer whose code conflicts with yours to minimize any issues and ensure a smooth integration.


## Merging

After your pull request has been reviewed, approved, and any conflicts have been resolved, it can be merged into the `dev` branch. Post-merge, the changes will be tested in the staging environment before deployment to production.

## Direct Commits Policy

Direct commits to the `develop` or `main` branch are not allowed, to maintain the organization and clarity of the project's codebase.

We thank you for adhering to these guidelines, which help us ensure a high standard for the Mathe-im-Advent project. Your contributions are invaluable, and we look forward to your innovative and efficient solutions.
